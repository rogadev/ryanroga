# RyanRoga.com

A portfolio website for Ryan Roga.

## Purpose

This project is a portfolio website for Ryan Roga. It is built with Astro 4 and TypeScript. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills as a developer and to provide a platform for potential employers to learn more about me and my work. The website is designed to be a single-page application with a focus on showcasing my work and providing a way for visitors to get in touch with me. Content for the website should be written in a way that is engaging and informative, while also being visually appealing and easy to navigate. It should be a good representation of my skills and abilities as a developer, and convey a tone of professionalism and enthusiasm for the work I do.

## Astro 4

This project is built with Astro 4. You can find the docs for Astro at https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/

## TypeScript

All script should be written in TypeScript whenever possible, unless there is a specific reason not to.

## Coding Best Practices

- All new components should be written in the src/components directory.
- All new pages should be written in the src/pages directory.
- All new utilities should be written in the src/utils directory.
- All new types should be written in the src/types directory.
- All new assets should be written in the public directory.
- All new layouts should be written in the src/layouts directory.

## The README

I fully expect potential employers to look at the README file to learn about me. Therefore, it should be well-written and engaging. As we add packages, update dependencies, and add new features, the README should be updated to reflect the current state of the project. Use markdown formatting and be sure to make the README as readable as possible. Ensure it is well structured, such that a potential employer could quickly jump to sections that are most relevant to them.

Astro Svelte TailwindCSS

As a part of my ITAS268 Final Project, I created the Victoria MossAway Portfolio using Astro, a modern frontend framework. Departing from traditional CMS platforms like Drupal or WordPress, I crafted a custom CMS solution tailored to my needs. Leveraging AI technology, I generated unique moss monster images and optimized text to enhance SEO and engage visitors effectively. Despite its short-lived duration due to the sale of MossAway, this portfolio site proved highly effective, ranking organically on Google and competently representing my work without conflicting with the SEO of the original MossAway site.

Window Cleaning Project Evaluation Tool
Live Repo

HTML CSS JavaScript

Initially developed during my first year of school, the Window Cleaning Project Evaluation Tool originated from a need within my previous business, which specialized in exterior cleaning services. Faced with the challenge of generating accurate window cleaning quotes efficiently, I identified a gap in available tools and decided to create a solution myself. Leveraging vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a mobile-friendly application that prioritized simplicity, speed, and effectiveness. This initial version proved highly successful in streamlining the quotation process. Currently, I'm actively enhancing the tool for a future version. This new iteration incorporates advanced features such as user authentication, personalized price sheets with save functionality, and a complete rewrite using modern technologies including Nuxt, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Through this ongoing development, I aim to further improve the tool's functionality and usability, catering to the evolving needs of window cleaning professionals.
